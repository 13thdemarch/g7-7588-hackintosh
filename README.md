## üíæ Installation

### BiOS Configuration
* Recommend you should restore the BIOS setting to Factory Setting first. Then configure the following things: 
    - UEFI Boot Path Security: **Never**
    - SATA Operation: **AHCI**
    - Enabled USB Boot Support: **Enabled**
    - Enable External USB Port: **Enabled**
    - Thunderbolt Security: **No Security**
    - Thunderbolt Boot Support: **Enabled**
    - Thunderbolt Auto Switch: **Native Enumeration**
    - PTT Security: **Disabled**
    - Secure Boot Enable: **Disabled**
    - Intel SGX: **Disabled**
    - VT for Direct I/O: **Disabled**
    - Auto OS Recovery Threshold: **Disabled**
    - SupportAssist OS Recovery: **Disabled**

## üõ† Hardware
This section talks about configuring the EFI folder for the hardware.

### Audio
* For ALC256 on this Dell, I use `layout-id = <56>`.
* Without any modifications, the headphone jack is buggy. External microphones aren't detected and the audio output may randomly stop working or start making weird noises. To permanently fix this issue, please go to [Post-Install](https://github.com/rex-lapis/Dell_G7_7588_OpenCore_Hackintosh#tweaks) for more information.

### Wi-Fi/Bluetooth
* The stock Intel AC 9560 now can be worked well with [OpenIntelWireless](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless), but it is not stable at all. So I replaced it with the Dell DW1560 card.
* If you have DW1820a card, it is worked too. But trust me, you don't want to use that card! The Wi-Fi speed is a bit slower and has problems with some 5GHz networks. Bluetooth sometimes has issues too.

### Graphic Display
* Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 630 support is handled by WhateverGreen, and configured in the `DeviceProperties` section of `config.plist`.
The NVIDIA GPU is not supported so it is disabled in SSDT.
The default BIOS DVMT pre-alloc value of `64MB` is sufficient and does not need to be changed.
#### Enabling acceleration
* DeviceProperties/Add/PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)
  * `AAPL,ig-platform-id = <0x3EA50009>`
#### Fixing backlight registers on CoffeeLake platform
* DeviceProperties/Add/PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)
  * `enable-backlight-registers-fix = <01000000>`
#### Enabling external display support
* Boot Argument
  * `agdpmod=vit9696`

### Sleep, Wake and Hibernation
* Hibernation is not supported on a Hackintosh and everything related to it should be completely disabled. Disabling additional features prevents random wakeups while the lid is closed. After every update, these settings should be reapplied manually.
```
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
sudo rm -f /var/vm/sleepimage
sudo mkdir /var/vm/sleepimage
sudo pmset -a standby 0
sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0
sudo pmset -a powernap 0
sudo pmset -a proximitywake 0
```

### CPU Performance
* CPU power management is done by `CPUFriend.kext` while `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext` defines how it should be done. `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext` is generated for a specific CPU and power setting. The one supplied in this repository was made for the i7-8750H. In case you have another CPU, you can use [one-key-cpufriend](https://github.com/stevezhengshiqi/one-key-cpufriend) to generate your own `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext`.

### iMessage/Facetime and App Store
* To use iMessage and other Apple services, you need to generate your own serial numbers. This can be done using [CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS). Make sure model is `MacBookPro15,1`. Then, go [Apple Check Coverage page](https://checkcoverage.apple.com/) to check your generated serial numbers. If the website tells you that the serial number **is not valid**, that is fine. Otherwise, you have to generate a new set.

* Next you will have to copy the following values to your `config.plist`:
  - Serial Number -> `PlatformInfo/Generic/SystemSerialNumber`
  - Board Number -> `PlatformInfo/Generic/MLB`
  - SmUUID -> `/PlatformInfo/Generic/SystemUUID`

  Reboot and Apple services should work.

* If they don't, follow [this in-depth guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html). It goes deeper into ROM, clearing NVRAM, clearing Keychain (missing this step might cause major issues), and much more.

## üîß Tweaks
* There is a script file in `Post-Install` folder. Run it after you're already finished installing macOS. It will help to fix the output and input audio when you plug 3.5mm headphone/headset/external speaker in, and disable hibernation for enhancing sleep.
* Disable CFG-Lock (Highly recommend):
  * Run `modGRUBShell.efi` at OpenCore menu boot screen.
  * When `> grub` show up, type `setup_var 0x5BD 0x00`, hit Enter.
  * The screen will show `setting offset 0x5bd to 0x00`, that done. Then type `reboot` and hit Enter.
  * Now you can change `AppleXcpmCfgLock` in Kernel/Quirks from `True` to `False`.
