## Installation

<details>  
<summary><strong>BIOS Configuration</strong></summary>
</br>

<details>  
<summary><strong>Disable CFG-Lock</strong></summary>
</br>

* Before installing, you should disable CFG-Lock because I have already disabled `AppleXcpmCfgLock` (`KernelXCPM` in Clover) key in `config.plist`.
* Simply just run the `CFGUnlock.efi` tool in OpenCore's GUI, press `Y` and hit Enter. Then reboot the machine. Now you can boot into macOS installation normally.
* For Clover user, you have to run is via `UEFI Shell` tool at Clover's boot menu.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Mainly Configuration</strong></summary>

### Graphic Display
* Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 630 support is handled by WhateverGreen, and configured in the `DeviceProperties` section of `config.plist`.
The NVIDIA GPU is not supported so it is disabled in SSDT.
The default BIOS DVMT pre-alloc value of `64MB` is sufficient and does not need to be changed.
  #### Enable acceleration
  * DeviceProperties/Add/PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)
    * `AAPL,ig-platform-id = <0900A53E>`
  #### Fix backlight registers on CoffeeLake platform
  * DeviceProperties/Add/PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)
    * `enable-backlight-registers-fix = <01000000>`
  #### Enable external display support
  * DeviceProperties/Add/PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)
    * `agdpmod = <vit9696>`
  #### Customize the behavior of the backlight
    * `enable-backlight-smoother = <01000000>`
    * `backlight-smoother-steps = <23000000>`
    * `backlight-smoother-interval = <07000000>`
    * `backlight-smoother-threshold = <2C010000>`

### Audio
* For ALC256 on this G7, I use `layout-id = <0E000000>`, it means `14`.
* Without any modifications, the headphone jack is buggy. External microphones aren't detected and the audio output may randomly stop working or start making weird noises.
* Start from this version, I change to use **ALCPlugFix-Swift** method, instead of old method `ComboJack`. It gives better sound experience and performance when using the headset/headphone. Thanks to [Juan-VC](https://github.com/Juan-VC/Hackintosh-macOS-Dell-G7-7588/blob/main/codec_dump.txt) about his ALC256 codec_dump and [black-dragon74](https://github.com/black-dragon74/ALCPlugFix-Swift) about his ALCPlugFix-Swift method. To permanently fix this issue, please go to [Post-Install](https://github.com/akisame-reiu/Dell_G7_7588_OpenCore_Hackintosh#post_install) for more information.
  #### Fix audio broken after rebooting from Windows into macOS
  * DeviceProperties/Add/PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1F,0x3)
    * `alctsel = <01000000>`
  #### Enable ALC Verbs support
  * DeviceProperties/Add/PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1F,0x3)
    * `alc-verbs = <01000000>`

### USB
* From this version, I support the USB map for Intel Wireless card only. If you're using Broadcom card, please check the folder with included the USB map kext for Broadcom card.
* The G7 7588 DSDT table has a few incorrect USB properties, but we can inject the correct properties via the kext which I've already mapped.

| Name | Port | Type     | Visible | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| HS01 | 1    | Type A   | Yes     | |
| HS02 | 2    | Type A   | Yes     | |
| HS03 | 3    | Type A   | Yes     | |
| HS05 | 5    | Internal | Yes     | Integrated Webcam |
| HS07 | 7    | Internal | No      | Broadcom card's Bluetooth, Broadcom kext only |
| HS09 | 9    | Internal | Yes     | Goodix Fingerprint |
| HS14 | 14   | Internal | Yes     | Intel card's Bluetooth |
| SS01 | 17   | Type 3   | Yes     | |
| SS02 | 18   | Type 3   | Yes     | |
| SS03 | 19   | Type 3   | Yes     | |

### Wireless, Bluetooth
* The stock Intel AC 9560 can be worked well with [OpenIntelWireless](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless).
* There are some Broadcom cards like DW1560, DW1820A, BCM94360NG, which can use AirDrop well, are compatible with this machine. If you have them, this EFI is worked well. Make sure you have to add wireless and bluetooth kexts correctly (except BCM94360NG, this card is native with macOS, **don't use any kexts!**).

### Sleep, Wake and Hibernation
* Hibernation is not supported on a Hackintosh and everything related to it should be completely disabled. Disabling additional features prevents random wakeups while the lid is closed. After every update, these settings should be reapplied manually.
```
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0
sudo pmset -a powernap 0
sudo pmset -a standby 0
sudo pmset -a proximitywake 0
sudo pmset -a tcpkeepalive 0
sudo rm -f /var/vm/sleepimage
sudo mkdir /var/vm/sleepimage
```
* Sleep and wake are improved and very fast now. Also, you can use shortcut key `Fn + Insert` to correct sleep on this machine. For more infomation, please check the [OpenCore 0.6.8](https://github.com/akisame-reiu/Hackintosh-Dell-G7-7588-OpenCore/blob/main/Changelog.md#v068) changelog.

### CPU Power Management
* CPU power management is done by `CPUFriend.kext` while `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext` defines how it should be done. `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext` is generated for a specific CPU and power setting. The one supplied in this repository was made for the i7-8750H. In case you have another CPU, you should follow [this guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/pm.html) to generate your own `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext`.

<details>
<summary><strong>iServices</strong></summary>

* To use iMessage and other Apple services, you need to generate your own serial numbers. This can be done using [CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS). Make sure model is `MacBookPro15,1`. Then, go [Apple Check Coverage page](https://checkcoverage.apple.com/) to check your generated serial numbers. If the website tells you that the serial number **is not valid**, that is fine. Otherwise, you have to generate a new set.

* Next you will have to copy the following values to your `config.plist`:
  - Serial Number -> `PlatformInfo/Generic/SystemSerialNumber`.
  - Board Number -> `PlatformInfo/Generic/MLB`.
  - SmUUID -> `/PlatformInfo/Generic/SystemUUID`.
  Reboot and Apple services should work.

* If they don't, follow [this in-depth guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html). It goes deeper into ROM, clearing NVRAM, clearing Keychain (missing this step might cause major issues), and much more.

## Post Installation

<details>  
<summary><strong>Dell G7 7588 Post-Install Script</strong></summary>
</br>

* Move `Post-Install` folder to `Desktop` and run after you're already finished installing macOS. It will help to fix the output and input audio when you plug 3.5mm headphone/headset/external speaker in, and disable hibernation for enhancing sleep.
